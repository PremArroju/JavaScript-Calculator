This is a basic JavaScript Program for beginners

A basic calculator JavaScript program performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It typically consists of an HTML interface with buttons for numbers and operators, and a JavaScript code to handle user input and perform calculations.

Here's a step-by-step description of how a basic calculator JavaScript program works:

##HTML Structure: The HTML file contains the structure of the calculator interface. It includes buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), and special buttons (like clear, equals).

##JavaScript Code: The JavaScript code handles user interactions and performs calculations. It typically involves the following steps:

Event Handling: JavaScript listens for user input events, such as clicking on buttons.

Button Click Handling: When a button is clicked, the corresponding action is determined. For example, if a digit button is clicked, the digit is appended to the input display. If an operator button is clicked, the operation is stored along with the current input value.

Performing Calculations: When the equals button is clicked, the stored operation and input values are used to perform the calculation. This involves parsing the input string, extracting the numbers and operator, and applying the operation to obtain the result.

Displaying Results: The result of the calculation is displayed on the calculator screen.

Clearing: A clear button might be provided to reset the calculator's state.

Styling: CSS styling might be applied to make the calculator visually appealing and user-friendly.

Overall, the program enables users to perform simple arithmetic calculations directly within a web browser by interacting with the provided interface.
